This website is an assignment by The Odin Project to
confirm that I've learned some basic html skills. Said 
basic skills include creating a boilerplate, using 
appropriate headers, using images, and mostly just having
a full website layout with links between pages and a 
folder for images and such. I've not done that before, 
only ever working on single html pages.
